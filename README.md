# CNN-Model-for-Lung-Opacity-Detection-by-X-ray-images

## Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for classifying instances from chest X-ray images. The model distinguishes between conditions, including healthy cases and lung opacity.

## Data

- Original dataset : Kermany, Daniel; Zhang, Kang; Goldbaum, Michael (2018), “Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification”, Mendeley Data, V2, doi: 10.17632/rscbjbr9sj.2
- Due to the fact that original dataset is too heavy , I randomly extracted some of images from the original dataset. My dataset has 550 images for train and 74 images for test.

## Result
Our CNN model achieved best result on the 6th epock on the test dataset by the overall accuracy of 89 percent.
